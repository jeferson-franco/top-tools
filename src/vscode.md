#### [Bookmarks](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks)

It helps you to navigate in your code, moving between important positions easily and quickly. _No more need to search for code_. It also supports a set of **selection** commands, which allows you to select bookmarked lines and regions between bookmarked lines. It's really useful for log file analysis.

---

#### [EditorConfig](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode)

This plugin attempts to override user/workspace settings with settings found in `.editorconfig` files. No additional or vscode-specific files are required. As with any EditorConfig plugin, if `root=true` is not specified, EditorConfig will continue to look for an `.editorconfig` file outside of the project.

`config` `editor` `editorconfig` `multi-root ready`

---

#### [ES7+ snippets](https://github.com/ults-io/vscode-react-javascript-snippets)

JavaScript and React/Redux snippets in ES7+ with Babel plugin features.

---

#### [Format Files](https://github.com/jbockle/format-files)

Formats all files in the current workspace/selected folder/glob. Due to the limitations in VSCode API, this opens each file, runs formatting command, saves the file (other save actions are started as well, to support features such as `tslint.autoFixOnSave` on typescript files), then closes it. The time to complete depends on the number of files and how large the files are.

---

#### [Git Graph](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph)

View a Git Graph of your repository, and easily perform Git actions from the graph.
